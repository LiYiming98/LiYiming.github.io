I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2020 and 2023, respectively. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the [National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing](https://rsp.xidian.edu.cn/) at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research focuses on radar target recognition and machine learning.
